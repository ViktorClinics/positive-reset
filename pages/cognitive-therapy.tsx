              Cognitive behavioral therapy is a common type of mental health
              counseling (psychotherapy). With cognitive behavioral therapy, you
              work with a mental health counselor (psychotherapist or therapist)
              in a structured way, attending a limited number of sessions.
              Cognitive behavioral therapy helps you become aware of inaccurate
              or negative thinking, so you can view challenging situations more
              clearly and respond to them in a more effective way.

              Cognitive behavioral therapy can be a very helpful tool in
              treating mental disorders or illnesses, such as anxiety or
              depression. But not everyone who benefits from cognitive
              behavioral therapy has a mental health condition. It can be an
              effective tool to help anyone learn how to better manage stressful
              life situations.
