                Community integration is integral to recovery for individuals
                with severe mental illness. We explored the integration of
                individuals with severe mental illness into mental health and
                non–mental health communities and associations with mental
                health service intensity.

                We are working with our partners to survey mental health clinics
                to better understand their experience of integrating behavioral
                health care lines with physical care. In our practice, we use
                survey results and highlight three trends emerging in the mental
                health industry.
