              <Text>
                Knowing how to interview someone the right way is an important
                part of the hiring process. When you ask the right questions,
                you can better understand the contents of a candidate’s resume
                and/or cover letter. The questions you ask when conducting an
                interview also allow you to measure the candidate’s ability to
                think quickly, describe how they overcame challenges or
                contributed to the success of projects, and if they’re able to
                perform expected work tasks. Additionally, a job interview can
                help you compare potential candidates with others to choose the
                one that best fits the needs of the role.

                Because each question asked in a job interview should be
                intentional, it’s important to prepare ahead of time, carefully
                assess the role you’re hiring for and ask a wide variety of
                interview questions. Consider coming up with a list of interview
                questions ahead of time.

                Deciding who should conduct your company’s interviews is a
                crucial part of setting up the interview process. If possible,
                it’s often a good idea for the new hire’s direct supervisor to
                conduct the interviews. Since they’ll work alongside the
                employee in their new role, they’re likely the best judge of who
                would best fit the position.

                One of the best ways to keep an interview from feeling stale or
                repetitive is to ask creative and dynamic questions. Asking
                common questions, such as questions about their personal
                strengths, will likely prompt a rehearsed and unoriginal answer.
                To facilitate an interesting and meaningful conversation, try
                asking questions that catch the interviewee off-guard.

            <Title>QUESTIONS TO AVOID WHEN CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS:</Title>
            <Text>
              While it’s important to be thorough when conducting an interview,
              so you can learn as much as possible about a potential candidate,
              there are certain topics and questions that should be avoided or
              carefully worded. This is to ensure that you don’t unintentionally
              discriminate against an interviewee or infringe on a candidate’s
              right to privacy. Some areas where you might want to tread lightly
              during an interview include:
            </Text>
          </BlockOne>
          <Block>
            <Ul>
              <Li>
                Age: While it’s okay to verify whether an applicant meets the
                minimum age requirements for a job, individuals aged 40 and
                older are protected by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
                of 1967, which prevents employers from discriminating against
                both potential and current employees based on their age. A
                better question to ask is whether the interview meets the
                minimum age requirements for the job if it’s not clearly
                apparent, without asking for an exact number.
              </Li>
              <Li>
                Disabilities: Individuals with disabilities are protected
                against discrimination under the Americans With Disabilities
                Act. Asking an applicant directly whether they’re disabled can
                lead to complaints later on if that worker is terminated or
                feels discriminated against in the workplace. While certain
                disabilities may be visibly obvious, such as an applicant using
                a mobility device, it’s best to simply ask whether the applicant
                possesses the capabilities needed to perform the job at hand.
              </Li>
              <Li>
                Religious topics: Inquiring about someone’s religious beliefs
                should always be avoided unless the job in question is for a
                faith-based organization. However, in some situations, an
                applicant may require additional accommodations due to their
                religion. In this case, it would be the responsibility of the
                applicant to advise the employer of their needs once they’re
                hired.
