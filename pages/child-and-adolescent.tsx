                Many treatments are available for child and adolescent mental
                health symptoms.

                Some are backed by science (i.e., “evidence-based treatments”),
                and some are not.

                We provide children and adolescents, ages 5 through 18, with
                support and coping skills to achieve emotional health and
                improved functioning through individual and family counseling.
                Play therapy allows younger children, who often are unable to
                communicate verbally, to express their feelings through art,
                activities, and toys.

              We counsel children with challenges such as attention disorders,
              learning differences, and behavioral issues. Parents are
              incorporated into the treatment plan so that they can provide
              intervention and additional support at home.

              Our expert counselors are available to speak on a variety of

              relationships at area synagogues and schools.
