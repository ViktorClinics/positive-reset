                When you’re looking to buy or start your own company in US, you
                have several options. You could start from scratch, building
                your own original business from the ground up. You could buy an
                existing stand-alone business someone has already built. Or, you
                might buy into a franchise business model, system (either an
                existing business or a new one). As with any of these options,
                franchise business models come with their own set of pros and
                cons, but sometimes they make a lot of sense for a business
                owner.

                The franchise has, hopefully, already done the work of building
                a brand and patients trust. That means you’re more likely to
                have customers as soon as you open, and you can even leverage on
                existing knowledge of the brand to build excitement for the
                opening beforehand. Your business is backed by the overall
                franchise, which means you have more leeway for growing pains
                than you might with a stand-alone small business.
