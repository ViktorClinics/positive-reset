                Before planning out a new office layout, you need to work with
                Positive Reset Services headquarter office to confirm the
                following:
                <br />
                • Number of employees on-site, by department. <br />
                • Employees that require private offices.
                <br />
                • Number of remote or flex employees who may occasionally
                require a workstation.
                <br />
                • Department-specific needs for location or desk configuration.
                Do certain departments collaborate often?

                Before even looking for office space, you may want to make a
                list of everything you will need in your new office, from desks
                and chairs to computer hardware, as well as any tasks like
                setting up your internet connection. Knowing your business needs
                will help ensure you choose the correct office size and location
                to support yourself and team members who share your workspace.

                Once you add everything on your checklist, consider the layout
                of your office space. This will help you to confirm how much
                furniture to buy. For example, do you need official entrance and
                waiting room: because you will be accepting patients, private
                room for employee meetings? Should a doctor, social worker or
                counselors have their own room? Break room or kitchen: It’s nice
                to give employees a place for breaks. It’s helpful to have a
                refrigerator and microwave too. Based on the amount of rooms you
                have and the kind of work being done, your floor plan can
                maximize your office space for productivity.
